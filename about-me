            <p>My name is Sertac Ozercan. I work at Microsoft as Partner Engineer in San Francisco, CA.</p>

<p>I received my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Troy University in 2006. In 2010, I received my Master’s degree in Computer Science from Ohio University, and continued in to the PhD program for Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with concentration in Computer Science. During my graduate work, I worked as a Research Assistant in the <a href="http://vital.cs.ohio.edu">VITAL Lab</a> in Ohio University. At the VITAL Lab, I was involved with educational game development for middle school, high school and college students. I was responsible for designing and developing educational games in multi-disciplinary environment using agile software development methodologies. In addition to development, I also coordinated product development, and make design decisions based on the qualitative and quantitative data received from research to improve the user experience, and engagement.</p>

<p>I got my startup experience working as a Software Engineering Intern at Blue Shell Games and CosmiCube in San Francisco, designing and developing mobile applications. During my work in CosmiCube, I worked in development of a shuffleboard-like game called Rebound for Mattel Inc.</p>
