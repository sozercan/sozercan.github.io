<p>He is spot on. These are my favorite parts from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We replaced core subsystems in the operating system, with poor transitions paths. We introduced compatibility layers that were not really compatible, nor were they maintained. When faced with “this does not work”, the community response was usually “you are doing it wrong”.</p>
  
  <p>The only way to fix Linux is to take one distro, one set of components as a baseline, abadone everything else and everyone should just contribute to this single Linux. Whether this is Canonical’s Ubutu, or Red Hat’s Fedora or Debian’s system or a new joint effort is something that intelligent people will disagree until the end of the days.</p>
